We are going to leave today open as a catch up and/or review day for Django concepts. There was a lot of content thrown at you and this is your day to catch your breath. We are available to do impromptu lectures as needed.

Focus mostly on the [Ticketmaster](https://github.com/codeplatoon/ticketmaster) challenge for today as it combines nearly all of the concepts we've been learning the last week. If you are done, move onto a 'pick-your-own' project: make a website that uses **at least 2** third-party APIs. Need ideas? Check [here](https://rapidapi.com/?utm_campaign=easiest-api-to-learn&utm_medium=link&utm_source=quora) and [here](https://apilist.fun/).

We start React tomorrow!
