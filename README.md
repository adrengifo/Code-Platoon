# Self Paced Curriculum

### Welcome
Code Platoon's mission is to help bridge the gap between a military career and the tech world by turning veterans and military spouses into software developers in a condensed timeframe. In this repository, you will find our entire curriculum that you can work through on your own.

### Getting started on Code Platoon's Self-Paced Program.
If you are new to coding, you should start by [going through part our Intro To Coding](https://www.codeplatoon.org/intro-to-coding/). Once you have completed the Intro To Coding, head over to Week 1. 

In the case that you have questions about the Full-Time Immersive Web Developer Program, please email us: info@codeplatoon.org
